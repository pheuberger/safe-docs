# `execTransaction`
Defined in [`Executor.sol`](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/tree/main/contracts/Safe.sol#L111)

## Overview

```solidity
function execTransaction(
    address to,
    uint256 value,
    bytes data,
    Enum.Operation operation,
    uint256 safeTxGas,
    uint256 baseGas,
    uint256 gasPrice,
    address gasToken,
    address payable refundReceiver, bytes signatures) external payable returns (bool success)

```

Executes an `operation` (0: Call, 1: DelegateCall) transaction to `to` with `value` (Native Currency) and pays `gasPrice` * `gasLimit` in `gasToken` token to `refundReceiver`.

*The fees are always transferred, even if the user transaction fails. This method doesn't perform any sanity check of the transaction, such as if the contract at `to` address has code or not. It is the responsibility of the caller to perform such checks.*

This function emits the [`ExecutionSuccess`](../transaction-events/ExecutionSuccess.mdx) or [`ExecutionFailure`](../transaction-events/ExecutionFailure.mdx) events based on the transaction outcome.

## Returns

- **Type:** `bool`

Boolean indicating transaction's success.

## Parameters

### `to`
- **Type:** `address`

Destination address of Safe transaction.

### `value`
- **Type:** `uint256`

Ether value of Safe transaction.

### `data`
- **Type:** `bytes`

Data payload of Safe transaction.

### `operation`
- **Type:** `Enum.Operation`

Operation type of Safe transaction.

### `safeTxGas`
- **Type:** `uint256`

Gas that should be used for the Safe transaction.

### `baseGas`
- **Type:** `uint256`

Gas costs that are independent of the transaction execution (e.g. base transaction fee, signature check, payment of the refund).

### `gasPrice`
- **Type:** `uint256`

Gas price that should be used for the payment calculation.

### `gasToken`
- **Type:** `address`

Token address (or 0 if ETH) that is used for the payment.

### `refundReceiver`
- **Type:** `address payable`

Address of receiver of gas payment (or 0 if tx.origin).

### `signatures`
- **Type:** `bytes`

Signature data that should be verified. Can be packed ECDSA signature ((bytes32 r)(bytes32 s)(uint8 v)), contract signature (EIP-1271) or approved hash.
