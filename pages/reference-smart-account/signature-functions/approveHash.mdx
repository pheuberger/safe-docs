# `approveHash`
Defined in [`Safe.sol`](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/tree/main/contracts/Safe.sol#L368)

## Overview

```solidity
function approveHash(bytes32 hashToApprove) external

```

Marks hash `hashToApprove` as approved.

*This can be used with a pre-approved hash transaction signature. IMPORTANT: The approved hash stays approved forever. There's no revocation mechanism, so it behaves similarly to ECDSA signatures.*

This function emits the [`ApproveHash`](../signature-events/ApproveHash.mdx) event.

## Parameters

### `hashToApprove`
- **Type:** `bytes32`

The hash to mark as approved for signatures that are verified by this contract.
