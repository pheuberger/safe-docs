# `setGuard`
Defined in [`GuardManager.sol`](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/tree/main/contracts/base/GuardManager.sol#L71)

## Overview

```solidity
function setGuard(address guard) external

```

Set Transaction Guard `guard` for the Safe. Make sure you trust the guard.

*Set a guard that checks transactions before execution. This can only be done via a Safe transaction. ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Since a guard has full power to block Safe transaction execution, a broken guard can cause a denial of service for the Safe. Make sure to carefully audit the guard code and design recovery mechanisms.*

This function emits the [`ChangedGuard`](../guard-events/ChangedGuard.mdx) event.

## Parameters

### `guard`
- **Type:** `address`

The address of the guard to be used or the 0 address to disable the guard.
